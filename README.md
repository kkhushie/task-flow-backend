### Starting Project with Node.js and Express.js
This is a basic Node.js and Express.js project designed to get you started with building web applications. It provides a simple foundation to build upon and explore the possibilities of this powerful framework.

### Getting Started:

#### Prerequisites:
Ensure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system. You can download them from the official Node.js website (https://nodejs.org/en).
#### Install Dependencies: 
Open your terminal in the project directory and run npm install. This will install all the required dependencies listed in your package.json file.
#### Start the Server: 
Run node index.js in your terminal. This will start the Express server and your application will typically be accessible on http://localhost:3000 (default port) by default.
